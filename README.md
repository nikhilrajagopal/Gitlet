# Gitlet
• Implemented a miniaturized version-control system that replicates the functionalities of Git (i.e. GitHub) using Java
• Main functionalities include saving the contents of entire directories of files, restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits, viewing the history of your backups through a log functionality, maintaining related sequences of commits (i.e. branches), and merging changes made in one branch into another branch
• Utilized serialization and cryptographic hash functions to store and access different versions of files in a repository
